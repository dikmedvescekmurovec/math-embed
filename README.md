# Math Embed
A simple service for generating embeddable links to math equations in LaTeX.

Say you're writing a technical or mathematical article that requires equations on Medium. It currently doesn't support a simple way to include them.
That's where Math Embed comes into play. You can visit the [Math Embed website](https://mathembed.online) or simply install the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/math-embed-from-latex-to/fmgpfoppldjbnbceiigndhdcmgmmflll?hl=sl) and start generating equations with LaTeX.
